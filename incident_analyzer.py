    **MULTI-CHANNEL INCIDENT CORRELATION ANALYSIS**
    1. Find incident reports in scan-officer channel (GQS8W231C)
    2. Extract incident details (time, service, region, error description)
    3. Check deployment channels for activity around incident timeframe:
       - gradual-rollouts channel (C02PKC70HEZ) for gradual rollouts and feature flag changes
       - production channel (CJP11G7UK) for production deployments and releases
    4. Run analyze_github_deployment_correlation() to find related deployments/PRs from GitHub
    5. Check relevant feature flags that might have changed around incident time
    6. Correlate deployment messages across all deployment channels with incident timing
    7. Provide comprehensive cross-channel root cause analysis

    **For each incident, provide:**
    - **Incident Summary**: What happened and when
    - **Deployment Activity Check**:
      * Gradual rollouts channel messages around incident time
      * Production channel deployment notifications around incident time
    - **GitHub Correlation**: Recent PRs/deployments within 6 hours of incident with enhanced code analysis
    - **Feature Flag Analysis**: Relevant flags that might be related to the incident
    - **Cross-Channel Timeline**: Timeline showing incident vs deployment activity across all channels
    - **Root Cause Assessment**: Multi-source analysis of potential causes

    Focus on correlating incidents with deployment activity across all deployment channels (gradual-rollouts + production) and GitHub."""),

    Perform comprehensive multi-channel incident analysis:

    **IMPORTANT: Today is 2025-09-16. Use this date to calculate "last 24 hours" properly.**

    **STEP 1: Find Incidents**
    - Analyze GQS8W231C (scan-officer) channel for incident reports from the last 24 hours (2025-09-15 to 2025-09-16)
    - Extract incident time, affected service, and region for each incident found

    **STEP 2: Check Deployment Activity**
    - For each incident, check deployment channels for messages around the incident timeframe (¬±2 hours) using the same date range (2025-09-15 to 2025-09-16):
      * C02PKC70HEZ (gradual-rollouts) - for gradual rollout announcements and feature flag changes
      * CJP11G7UK (production) - for production deployment notifications and release messages
    - Look for rollout announcements, deployment notifications, production releases, or configuration changes

    **STEP 3: GitHub Correlation**
    - Run analyze_github_deployment_correlation() with incident parameters
    - Look for PRs, merges, and deployments within 6 hours of each incident

    **STEP 4: Feature Flag Analysis**
    - Check relevant feature flags for each incident (maintenance-mode, circuit-breaker, rate-limiting, service-specific flags)
    - Focus on flags that might have been modified around incident time

    **STEP 5: Cross-Channel Timeline Analysis**
    - Create timeline showing:
      * Incident occurrence time
      * Gradual rollouts channel activity (¬±2 hours)
      * Production channel deployment activity (¬±2 hours)
      * GitHub deployment activity (¬±6 hours)
      * Feature flag status
    - Identify correlations between deployment messages and incidents across all channels

    Provide comprehensive analysis showing if incidents correlate with deployment activity from Slack channels (gradual-rollouts + production) or GitHub.
